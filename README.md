# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It highlights my technical skills, showcases my projects, and provides an easy way to contact me.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-portfolio.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-portfolio
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you’re ready for it.
